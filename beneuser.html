                <p>Women's welfare schemes, especially in rural areas, empower economically disadvantaged women through education, healthcare, and skill development, fostering stability
                     and growth. Some focus on supporting pregnant women and new mothers, offering prenatal care and maternity benefits. Education, including scholarships and vocational
                      training, promotes independence, benefiting women from diverse backgrounds and life stages, driving holistic development for a more empowered future.</p>

                <h2>Child</h2>
                <p>Child welfare schemes provide essential support for children across diverse socio-economic backgrounds, especially in rural areas. These initiatives offer vital services
                     in healthcare, nutrition, and education, ensuring a brighter future for underprivileged children. Specialized programs target vulnerable groups like orphans and street
                      children, providing shelter, education, and rehabilitation. These schemes ensure that every child has access to fundamental rights and opportunities for growth and well-being.</p>
